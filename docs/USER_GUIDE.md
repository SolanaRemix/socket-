# 📖 REPO BRAIN HOSPITAL: Step-by-Step User Guide (V2.2)

Welcome to the CyberAI Oracle Network. Follow these steps to hospitalize and heal your repository fleet.

### 1. Global Installation (Windows)
- Run `.\install.ps1` in the root directory.
- This installs the `brainctl` shim globally in your user PATH.
- Restart your terminal and run `brainctl help` to verify.

### 2. Standalone Dashboard (Packing brain.exe)
If you want to run the Operator Dashboard as a native Windows application:
1. Open PowerShell in the project root.
2. Run `brainctl pack`.
3. Locate `brain.exe` in your project folder. This executable contains the UI and the Brain CLI.

### 3. Fleet Admission
- Navigate to your project folder.
- Run `brainctl run` to initiate the 18-Phase MERMEDA Protocol.
- The system will detect your stack (Next, Angular, Rust, etc.) and generate a **Health Score (1-100)**.

### 4. Self-Healing (The Surgeon)
If your brain scripts become corrupted or missing:
- Run `brainctl heal`.
- This command performs a genomic restoration of all `.repo-brain` modules, ensuring your environment is synchronized with the latest CyberAI spec.

### 5. Interpreting the Score
- **90-100 (GREEN)**: Nominal. Governance standards fully met.
- **50-89 (AUTO_FIXABLE)**: Minor drift. Click **Wire PR Repair** to automate remediation.
- **0-49 (RED)**: Pathological. Security secrets or unsafe logic detected. Run **Autopsy** immediately.

### 6. Mission Control Analytics
- Use the main dashboard to monitor Fleet Integrity Distribution.
- Use the **Safety Firewall** (`brainctl firewall-install`) to view active denial rules preventing secret leakage.
