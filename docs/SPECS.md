# ⚙️ REPO BRAIN HOSPITAL Technical Specs (V2.2.0)

## Architecture
REPO BRAIN HOSPITAL V2.2.0 resides in `.repo-brain/` and is managed via the `brainctl` CLI. It uses a polyglot-aware engine to detect environments and enforce best-practice CI/CD configurations.

## V2.2.0 Oracle Release Enhancements
1. **Neural Bridge Grafting**: Automated authentication repair logic for GitHub Actions feedback loops.
2. **Hardhat Motor Function**: Verified Hardhat + TypeScript compilation cycles for Web3 repositories.
3. **Phase 18 Test Suite**: Self-verifying logic modules that test the brain's own scripts before execution.
4. **Vercel Troubleshooting**: Integrated logic to diagnose and repair build failures specifically for Vercel/Next.js deployments (OOM & Standalone mode).
5. **Copilot Integration**: Enhanced `.github/copilot-instructions.md` generation with AI Guard pathology reports.
6. **SmartBrain Oracle**: Large Language Model integration for deep trace troubleshooting via Gemini 3 Series.

## Infrastructure
- **POSIX Shell**: Core runners are written in pure Bash/Zsh for portability.
- **Node.js Fallback**: Provides `json-cli.js` to replace `jq` on environments lacking the binary.
- **Integrity Lock**: SHA-256 signatures for management components.
- **Vitals Tracking**: High-fidelity tracking of repo size, commit age, and build efficiency.

## Governance Protocol (MERMEDA)
- **Phase 01-03**: Environmental & Stack Detection.
- **Phase 08**: Canonical Workflow Deployment.
- **Phase 12**: AI Guard Security Scans (Credentials & Injection).
- **Phase 18**: Autonomous logic verification.
