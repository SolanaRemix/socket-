# 🛡️ REPO BRAIN: Pathological Advisory
- **Target File**: `brain.guard.sh`
- **Genome Signature**: Standard Stack

### ⚠️ Security Pathologies Detected:
- CRITICAL: Unsafe shell execution pattern (High risk of Command Injection)
- CRITICAL: Arbitrary Code Injection vulnerability detected (Usage of eval or dynamic code evaluation)

### 🩺 Surgical Recommendation:
1. **Credential Hygiene**: NEVER hardcode API keys or secrets. Transition to encrypted environment variables or Secret Management systems.
2. **Shell Security**: Avoid shell-based execution. If necessary, use parameterized arguments and avoid string concatenation.
3. **Input Validation**: Sanitize all inputs before passing them to dynamic execution contexts.
