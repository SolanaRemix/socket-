# 🛡️ REPO BRAIN: Pathological Advisory
- **Target File**: `brain.ai.guard.sh`
- **Genome Signature**: Web3-Enhanced

### ⚠️ Security Pathologies Detected:
- CRITICAL: Unsafe shell execution pattern (High risk of Command Injection)
- WARNING: Potential shell wrapping vulnerability via -c flag
- PATHOLOGICAL: OpenAI Secret Key exposure detected
- PATHOLOGICAL: Anthropic API Key exposure detected
- PATHOLOGICAL: Google/Gemini API Key exposure detected
- WARNING: Generic sensitive credential identifier detected
- CRITICAL: Unsafe wallet initialization with potential hardcoded entropy
- WARNING: Unsafe HTTP RPC endpoint (Use TLS/HTTPS for provider security)

### 🩺 Surgical Recommendation:
1. **Credential Hygiene**: NEVER hardcode API keys or secrets. Transition to encrypted environment variables or Secret Management systems.
2. **Shell Security**: Avoid shell-based execution. If necessary, use parameterized arguments and avoid string concatenation.
3. **Input Validation**: Sanitize all inputs before passing them to dynamic execution contexts.
4. **Web3 Hardening**: Use HTTPS for RPC endpoints and ensure mnemonics/private keys are only accessed via secure vaulting.
