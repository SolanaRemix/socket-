# 🚀 REPO BRAIN HOSPITAL V2.2.0: Updates

### 🧬 Phase 18: Autonomous Test Suite
- **Logic Validation**: Introduced `brain.test.sh` to verify script integrity before graduation.

- **Web3 Hardening**: Specialized scanning for hardcoded Ethereum/EVM private keys and unsafe RPC endpoints.

### 🚀 Vercel forensic Troubleshooter
- **OOM Detection**: New module `brain.vercel.troubleshoot.sh` scans autopsy logs for Node.js memory failures.
- **Optimization Suggestions**: Automated recommendation to move to `output: 'standalone'` and pinned Node runtimes.

### 🎨 UI/UX Refinement
- **Surgery Station Grid**: Expanded the management dashboard for high-density action access.
