- **Target File**: `.env.example`
- **Genome Signature**: Standard Stack

### ⚠️ Security Pathologies Detected:
- PATHOLOGICAL: Google/Gemini API Key exposure detected

### 🩺 Surgical Recommendation:
1. **Credential Hygiene**: NEVER hardcode API keys or secrets. Transition to encrypted environment variables or Secret Management systems.
2. **Shell Security**: Avoid shell-based execution. If necessary, use parameterized arguments and avoid string concatenation.
3. **Input Validation**: Sanitize all inputs before passing them to dynamic execution contexts.
